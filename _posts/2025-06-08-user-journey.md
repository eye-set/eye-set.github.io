# Eye-Set User Journey

Welcome to the user journey of Eye-Set! This section will guide you through how our mesh-connected camera trap system can enhance your wildlife photography.

## First Setup

Devices does not have screen or configuration buttons. It relays on bluetooth for setup and configuration that is why you need to have your phone nearby during the first setup and our application.

Let's focus on camera node first. The camera node will connect to the phone via Bluetooth so it has to be in range and turn on. Once connected, the app will show it on the list of available devices. 

The camera node has preset default pin '123456' that will synchronize to you system `pin` once connected. If you aim to change system `pin`, you need to make sure that it is synced across all your devices.
